<p>My name is Konstantin Kuznetsov. I am an oceanographer and my reseach interest concentrate on wind and freak waves.
It includes in-situ observations and analysis (spectral and statistical) of waves,
numerical modeling of fully nonlinear wave-equations for free-surface.
</p>
<p>I passed my PhD in 2013 and topic of my thesis is "Experimental studies of wave motion in fluids of finite depths and numerical
simulation". My current position is Associate Professor at "People's Friendship University of Russia" in Moscow (often people call it "RUDN").

I really love C++ and trying to use as often as I can :). On this site I will realize some of my projects about wave analisys and numerical modeling.
This site is writed totally using C++ and library <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt">Wt</a>, for total control of projects. Source code of this module you can find here. Source code of this site you can here.

	<h4>Current projects:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Numerical modeling of freak waves (Zakharov-Diyachenko equations);</li>
		<li>Cross-comparison of numerics and experiments;</li>
		<li>Threatment of in-situ data (spectral and statistical analyse, database formation);</li>
        </ul>
